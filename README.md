# Udacity's Programming for Data Science

I am using Jupyter Lab to audit the python module of Udacity's course on **Programming for Data science.**

The course Includes modules on:

- SQL
- Shell
- Python Programming
- Git
- Data Visualization with Tableau


You can check out my SQL codes on this [repository](https://github.com/AadamBodunrin/SQL-for-Beginners). Although, I used the in-famous DVD Rental Database as opposed to the Parch and Porsey used in their videos.

The labelled notebook 1 - 8 are written codes to help with learning the python module. 

## Project Overview
THe use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States (Chicago, New York City, and Washington). The goal is to create a terminal application that gives a set of summary statistics for each city.


### Softwares/Tools used
- Jupyter lab (pandas)
- Azure Data Studio
- Windows Terminal


## Datasets

The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. The file sizes are too big to be uploaded on GitHub, so they were uploaded on Google Drive instead you can download them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16FfhNDfAh0DvTIRw9r0plmWZlHPEcBa4).
