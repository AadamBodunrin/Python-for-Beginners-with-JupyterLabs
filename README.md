# Udacity's Programming for Data Science

I am using Jupyter Lab to audit the python module of Udacity's course on **Programming for Data science.**

The course Includes modules on:

- SQL
- Shell
- Python Programming
- Git
- Data Visualization with Tableau


You can check out my SQL codes on this [repository](https://github.com/AadamBodunrin/SQL-for-Beginners). Although, I used the in-famous DVD Rental Database as opposed to the Parch and Porsey used in their videos.
